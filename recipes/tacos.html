            <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>3/4 cup diced onion</li>
            <li>1/2 lbs ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 lbs ground pork</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp oregano</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground chipotle pepper</li>
            <li>15 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups vegetable oil</li>
            <li>toothpicks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Fill a medium pot with water to the halfway mark, then place over a medium high flame. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Take your two potatoes and peel and dice them. Boil for 10 minutes. Remove from flame and drain. Set to the side.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan over a medium flame add olive oil and allow to get hot. Then add onion, and saute for 5  minutes. Mix frequently.</li>
            <li>When onions are translucent, add the ground beef, garlic, salt, black pepper, oregano, and ground chipotle pepper to the pan. Mix well and cook until ground beef turns brown.</li>
            <li>Then add boiled potatoes to the ground beef mixture. Mix well and remove from flame. Place in a bowl to start assembling your tacos.</li>
            <li>Warm your corn tortillas on an open flame for 15 seconds on each side. Then place them in a towel to stay warm or a tortilla holder. This step will keep your tortilla from breaking.</li>
            <li>In a large frying pan over a medium flame add vegetable oil and allow oil to warm while you assemble your tacos.</li>
            <li>Take a warm corn tortilla and fill with 1 1/2 tablespoons ground beef and potato mixture. Place the filling in the middle for easy folding.</li>
            <li>Then fold tortilla over and close taco with a toothpick right in the middle or use two toothpicks along the side. Continue until done with all tortillas.</li>
            <li>Your vegetable oil should be hot by now. Fry your tacos. Let sit about 5 minutes on each side or until gold brown and shell is hard.</li>
            <li>Move cooked tacos to a plate with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Remove toothpick closure, and fill with your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ol>
